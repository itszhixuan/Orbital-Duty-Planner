# Motivation
Have you ever experienced the difficulty of creating a schedule for an organisation/club that fully integrates the demands, preferences and availability of each employee/member? Almost every organisation and club will rely on a shift system to organise events/ensure that its operations run smoothly. However, the process of creating a schedule that caters to everyone's availability while having the meet the demands/requirements of their organisation (such as having a minimum number of shifts per month) can become very tedious and time-consuming. As the number of employees/members increase, the task at hand also gets exponentially harder.

# Our Solution
To help reduce the tedious process, we aim to create a duty planning program that helps our user organise shifts and schedules that takes in other people's preferences and availibility.

The src folder houses source codes and components that are available on our website.

# User Stories
As a part-timer working in retail, I would like to have my preferences and availability factored in when taking up shifts.

As an employee, I want to be able to request for a change in the allocated shift (due to preference) and have the system suggest alternative shifts without creating conflicting schedules for other employees.

As a commanding officer or HR manager, I would want to be able to leave the scheduling for my soldiers or staff to be handled automatically.

As a commanding officer or HR manager, I want to be able to integrate our organisationâ€™s preferences and rules (eg. no consecutive shifts) into the system to obtain a schedule catered to our organisation.

## Features
